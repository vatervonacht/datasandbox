# Data Sandbox
This is just a place to experiment with the overwhelming number of tools
and frameworks in the data, analytics, AI/ML space.  I need a place to
learn, but also to demonstrate concepts.  Hopefully, this is useful to 
someone.

## Overview
Basic idea is to leverage my personal laptop as an "environment" -- 
actually as a mockup of an on-prem environment.  So, no or very 
small clusters, no replication, slower, etc.  But good enough to 
understand and demonstrate the concepts.  

Then, of course, leverage the cloud as the ... well ... cloud
environment.  But also small-scale because I can't afford anything
beyond small scale.

Will do my best to adhere to best practices around DevOps, CI/CD, 
GitOps, TDD, etc. as well.  We'll see how that goes.
